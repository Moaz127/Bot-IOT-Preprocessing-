# Bot-IOT-Preprocessing-
This repository contains preprocessing scripts for the Bot-IoT dataset, preparing raw IoT network traffic data for anomaly-based intrusion detection research. The pipeline includes data cleaning, categorical feature encoding, numerical feature normalization, handling of class imbalance, and train/test splitting. Due to its large size, the dataset is not included in this repository and must be downloaded from the UNSW Canberra Cyber Range Lab. https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/bot-iot-dataset.
